# Occupational Dynasty

Code for keeping the project on the determinants and consequences of occupational dynasty

This project is part of a research project by Professor Siddharth George of the National University of Singapore and Professor Martin Shu of the Chinese University of Hong Kong.
Description: In many countries around the world, children tend to enter the same occupation as their parents. We refer to these as “occupational dynasties”, and describe patterns in their prevalence across countries, over time, and how they relate to the process of economic development. In this paper, we use microdata from the IPUMS website, to create a matrix called skill distance measures to measure how similar the skills that a parent uses in their occupation in comparison with their children. This paper finds that there is a surprising similarity in terms of the skills that children use in their work as compared to their parents. More work would have to be done by analyzing the distribution of the skill distance matrix of the other countries.
